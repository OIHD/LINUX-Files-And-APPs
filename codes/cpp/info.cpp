/*
main  // function 
{
statement ; // ";" end of statement 
}

int a ; //value initialization , // no initializer
int a {} ; // initializer after equals sign

a= 5 //copy assignment of value 5 into variable width [ Copy initialization ]

() // Direct initialization 
{} // Brace initialization

What is the difference between initialization and assignment?
Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.
